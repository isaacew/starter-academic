I am an Electronics Engineer in the Autonomous Controls branch in the Power and Control division of the Aerospace Systems Directorate in the Air Force Research Laboratory. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology in 2021, my MS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2011, and my BS in Mechanical Engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2009. I am currently a senior member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). I am an active member of both the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) and the IEEE Controls Systems Society (CSS). My research interests lie in automation and control of aerospace systems for defense applications.
