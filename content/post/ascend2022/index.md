Building a sustainable off-world future requires the collective effort of a diverse global community of students and professionals with the ideas, skills and passions to solve complex problems and inspire new ways of thinking. That’s why more than 3,000 technical experts, executives, entrepreneurs, and engineers — from classrooms through careers — attended the inaugural 2020 ASCEND in November 2020. Plan now to join us for the 2022 edition. The universe is expanding, and ASCEND is your space.
