abstract: "Conventional leader-follower formations restrict the follower to
a single desired position relative to the leader. To give the follower more
flexibility in motion and to replicate typical human pilot operations, in
this paper we propose a control architecture allowing the follower to
converge to a ring, which is a set of desired points, relative to the
leader. The follower is considered subject to a point-mass aircraft model,
which can be transformed into the double integrator kinematics. For that
reason, the nonlinear backstepping method is first utilized to design the
controller for the double integrator kinematics with input saturation
constraints being taken into account. The controller is then converted into
control variables for the point-mass model. The stability of the proposed
architecture is analyzed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to
illustrate the efficacy of the proposed controller."
