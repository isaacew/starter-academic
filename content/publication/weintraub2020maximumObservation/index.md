abstract: "This paper considers a two agent scenario containing an observer
and a non-maneuvering target. The observer is maneuverable but is slower
than the course-holding target. In this scenario, the observer is endowed
with a nonzero radius of observation within which he strives at keeping the
target for as long as possible. Using the calculus of variations, we pose
and solve the optimal control problem, solving for the heading of the
observer which maximizes the amount of time the target remains inside the
radius of observation. Utilizing the optimal observer heading we compute
the exposure time based upon the angle by which the target is initially
captured. Presented, along with an example, are the zero-time of exposure
heading, maximum time of observation heading, and proof that observation is
persistent under optimal control."
