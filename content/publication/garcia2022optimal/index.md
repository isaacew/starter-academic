abstract: "A conflict between rational and autonomous agents is considered. The paper addresses a differential game of protecting a target in the 3-D space. This problem highlights the strong correlation between the highly dynamic scenario, the uncertainty on the behavior of the adversary, and the online and robust computation of state-feedback strategies which guarantee the required level of performance of each player. This work significantly expands previous results around this problem by providing the playersâ€™ state-feedback saddle-point strategies. Additionally, the continuously differentiable Value function of the multi-agent differential game is obtained and it is shown to be the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. Finally, the Barrier surface is explicitly obtained which defines the winning team according to the current state of the game."
