abstract: "A method of configuring a wing velocity profile includes
segmenting a complete wingbeat cycle into a set of quarter
strokes including a first quarter-stroke, a second quarter
stroke, a third quarter-stroke, and a fourth quarter-stroke.
The method further includes generating time-varying quar
ter-stroke wing position commands for each of a first and
second wing planforms to produce wing flapping trajectories
that generate non-Zero, cycle averaged wing lift and drag
and alter a cycle average center of pressure of each of the
first and the second wing planforms relative to the aircraft.
The wing position commands include Velocities and posi tions with temporally symmetric and asymmetric quarter
stroke components for the first wing planform and the
second wing planform. The first wing planform and the
second wing planform produce controlled six-degrees-of
freedom vehicle motion without using actuators in excess of
the first actuator and the second actuator."
