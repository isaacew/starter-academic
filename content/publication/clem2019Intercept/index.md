abstract: "Combatant small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (CUAVs) can easily
enter restricted airspace and may be mitigated by counter UAVs.
Intercepting and following combatant UAVs in restricted airspace could be
achieved with multi-rotor UAVs. A pseudotarget based Proportional
Navigation (PN) guidance algorithm that guides a UAV to intercept and
follow a combatant UAV using highly uncertain sensor position information
was investigated. Simulations were performed to validate the model and
develop a ratio of following distance to initial range. Near zero following
distance was achieved for a finite
range of initial line-of-sight angles."
