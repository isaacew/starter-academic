abstract: "We consider a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical
environment in which a single vehicle, having a finite capture radius, aims
to defend a concentric perimeter from mobile intruders. The intruders are
arbitrarily released at the circumference of the environment and move
radially toward the perimeter with fixed speed. We present a competitive
analysis approach to this problem by measuring the performance of multiple
online algorithms for the vehicle against arbitrary inputs, relative to an
optimal offline algorithm that has access to all future inputs. In
particular, we first establish a necessary condition on the parameter space
to guarantee finite competitiveness of any algorithm, and then characterize
a parameter regime in which the competitive ratio is guaranteed to be at
least 2 for any algorithm. We then design and analyze three online
algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which they have finite
competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are provably 1,
and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm exhibits a
finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters. Finally,
we provide numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the
relative performance of our algorithms."
