abstract: "Typically, inertial loads associated with flapping wing micro
air vehicles are ignored for analysis and control law development purposes.
The goal of this work is to compute the inertial loads associated with
flapping a wing and compare those loads to aerodynamic loads. It is assumed
that the wing is a rigid flat plate so that there is no in-plane,
out-of-plane, or torsional bending of the wing. The analysis begins by
computing the acceleration of the wing center-of-gravity over a complete
wingbeat cycle. Newtonâ€™s second law is then used to compute the inertial
forces and eventually, the inertial moments. Simulation results are
provided which compare the magnitude of the inertial loads to the
aerodynamic loads for a wing of varying geometry."
