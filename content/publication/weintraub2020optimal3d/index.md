abstract: "An engagement scenario involving the defence of a
non-manoeuvrable agent, called the Target, is considered. A pursuing agent,
engages the non-manoeuvrable Target while a defending agent, which aims at
intercepting the Pursuer to protect the Target, is considered in
3-dimensions. A zero-sum differential game is formulated where the
objective of the Defender is to capture the Pursuer and maximise the
terminal Pursuer-Target range at final time; while the Pursuer aims at
minimising the terminal Pursuer-Target range at final time. The terminal
time is not fixed and is determined by the interception of the Pursuer by
the Defender. The saddle point state-feedback strategies for the Pursuer
and the Defender are obtained using a gradient-based minimisation routine.
A comparison of the saddle point strategy against a heuristic approach,
Pure Pursuit, is conducted. The comparison demonstrates that poorer
performance is achieved by players who deviate from the optimal saddle
point strategy; and, as a result, the saddle point strategies outperform
the heuristic method."
