abstract: "Most conventional formation control algorithms consider
convergence towards a specific desired point (or a specific desired
displacement) for each vehicle relative to their neighbors. However, this
specification restricts the flexibility in the motion of the vehicles.
Motivated from this standpoint, this paper considers a formation control
problem, where the desired position of each vehicle in the formation is
described by a set of points. In particular, we consider relative motion in
a two-vehicle system consisting of a leader and a follower, which is
scalable to a larger formation in a distributed manner. The leader is free
to move in 3-dimensional space while the follower seeks to converge to the
desired set of points. We especially consider the desired set to be a ring
of a given radius located at a certain distance from the leader in this
paper. In addition, we propose two control algorithms. Both of them allow
the follower to alter the set point smoothly during the mission and thus
increase the follower's flexibility of motion. The stability of the
formation under the proposed control algorithms is analyzed using the
Lyapunov theory. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the
efficacy of the control algorithms."
