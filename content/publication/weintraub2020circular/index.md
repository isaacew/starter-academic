abstract: "In this paper, the interception of a target vehicle is presented
utilizing a Bézier path. Utilizing the Bézier path, the controlled vehicle
is navigated from an initial point and velocity vector to a desired target
waypoint and velocity vector. To ensure a flyable path, control points of
the Bézier are adjusted using a nonlinear program that takes into account
maximum path curvature and vehicle performance criteria. A model predictive
controller is designed to provide the real-time controls that drive the
controlled vehicle along the Bézier path with minimal flight path error and
control effort. A numerical simulation, which demonstrates the ability to
navigate to a desired waypoint and velocity vector for circular rejoin, is
provided as an example."
