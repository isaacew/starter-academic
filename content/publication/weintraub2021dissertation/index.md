abstract: "Optimal control theory and differential game theory is applied
to the study of the defense of high value airborne assets, particularly in
the case of a single threat such as an adversarial aircraft or missile.
Rather than utilizing onboard defenses of the high value airborne asset,
defense is proposed using a teamed unmanned combat air vehicle. The common
scenario throughout this dissertation involves the defense of a high value
airborne asset (evader) teamed with an unmanned combat vehicle (defender)
against a single threat (pursuer). The unmanned combat air vehicle
(defender), provides defense in one of two ways: kinetic or directed
energy. When defense is kinetic in nature, the defender launches a missile
which strives to reach the threat before the threat reaches the high value
airborne asset -- damage to the pursuer is dealt through capture. When
defense is provided through directed energy, the defender strives to keep
the incoming threat inside his weapon engagement zone for as long as
possible -- damage to the pursuer is dealt over time. Leveraging
differential game theory and optimal control theory, a series of scenarios
are proposed and solved which illustrate different optimal strategies for
the successful defense of a high value airborne asset against the incoming
threat. In the event that defense is kinetic in nature, the defender-evader
team strives to be as far (in range) from the captured pursuer at final
time while the pursuer strives to minimize said range. When defense is
provided by means of directed energy, the pursuer strives to capture the
evader in minimum time while the defender strives to maximally expose the
pursuer prior to the evader's capture. In addition to considering the
optimal strategies for the successful defense of a high value airborne
asset against an incoming threat, an investigation of various numerical
methods is conducted. The investigation compares and contrasts four
different direct methods. The comparisons between the different numerical
methods are used to suggest a single method that may be applicable for
future hardware implementation."
