abstract = {The Monty Hall problem can be a useful exercise in statistics and probability classes. Besides the lively interaction of students proposing various arguments (for or against) the answer, some students begin to consider problems and games where the Monty Hall dilemma may be hidden beneath the surface. Since Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? continues to be a popular game show, one problem raised in class is "How does the probability of choosing the correct answer differ depending on the elimination method used by the 50:50 lifeline?" This question is of particular interest to students since probabilistic choices determine a contestant's winnings. This paper will examine the probability calculations of two possible elimination methods.},
