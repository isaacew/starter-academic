abstract: "The goal of optimal control is to obtain an admissible function
which minimizes an objective functional subject to specified constraints
and boundary conditions. Four popular methods of computing the optimal
control directly are the Single Shooting Method, Multiple Shootings Method,
Even Collocation Method, and Pseudospectral Method. In this paper, the four
direct methods of computing the optimal control for the Active Target
Defense Scenario are presented and compared. The Active Target Defense
Scenario is a three-agent engagement where an evading agent tries to escape
a pursuing agent with the assistance of a defending agent. The goal of the
Evader is to maneuver in such a way as to assist the Defender in capturing
the Pursuer while maximizing his range from the Pursuer. This work begins
by describing each direct method and summarizing advantages and
disadvantages of each. Next, each method is used to solve the optimal
control for the Active Target Defense Scenario; results are presented and a
comparison of the performance of each method is made. Finally, concluding
remarks describing the results, performance, and real-time implementation
are presented."
