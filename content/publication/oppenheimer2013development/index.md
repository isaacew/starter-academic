abstract: "This work is focused on testing multiple versions of flapping
wing mechanisms to improve the lift generating capabilities of the
mechanisms. Three mechanisms are considered in this work, a traditional
four bar linkage version, a four bar mechanism which used ball joints, and
a four bar mechanism with a sector and output gear for amplified motion.
The traditional four bar version has a wing stroke amplitude of about 55â—¦
while the other two mechanisms have an amplitude of nearly 90 deg. The
criteria for comparison is the lift force generating capacity of each
mechanism. For each mechanism, the forward kinematics are derived for use
in a table lookup so that symmetric and asymmetric flapping can be achieved
as desired."
