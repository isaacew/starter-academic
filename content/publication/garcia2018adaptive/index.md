abstract: "Coordination and cooperation of networked multi-agent systems is usually constrained by dynamic and communication limitations. In this work we consider the problem of distributed leader following of heterogeneous and uncertain multi-agent systems. Each agent or subsystem implements a local and completely decentralized adaptive controller in order to compensate for the uncertainty on its system parameters. At the inter-agent communication level and due to the limitations on broadcasting continuous signals, each agent employs a decentralized event-triggered multi-agent system (MAS) controller which tracks the state of the leader and reduces broadcasting of information. Hence, the two layer controller architecture provides a useful framework for the multiple agents to follow the leader in the presence of system uncertainties and absence of continuous exchange of information."
