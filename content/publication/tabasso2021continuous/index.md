abstract: "In this work, a continuous monitoring scenario where multiple
unmanned aerial vehicles are tasked to monitor a dynamic target moving
along a path with unknown speed profile is addressed. Optimal trajectories
based on the nominal trajectory of the target are generated offline. If
changes in the speed profile of the target are detected, the agents’
trajectories can be modified online to ensure that the monitoring
requirements are met, while still maintaining intervehicle safety
guarantees. The time-coordination algorithm proposed as a solution to this
problem is based on a leader–follower structure. The unmanned aerial
vehicles are assumed to exchange information over a communication network
where limited quality of service, switching topologies, and data package
dropouts are considered. Finally, performance bounds and simulation results
to prove the efficacy of our method are provided."
